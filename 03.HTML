The forces that shape it are unknown to most of its denizens. It resides in a pocket dimension, separate from both Heaven and Hell. The Priests of Rathma believe that Sanctuary lies upon the back of Trag'Oul. At times, over the centuries, Sanctuary and Hell touch in a manner that allows the summoning of demons into the mortal realm to be easier than it might otherwise be. Some of Hell's most dangerous creatures have made their way into this world.. The world possesses a single moon that has lunar phases.

    Sanctuary has seasons such as autumn and winter, both of which occur late in Sanctuary's calendar year. Harvest is carried out in the former, in order to survive the rigors of the latter. On the last day of harvest season, the wisest folk lock their doors, hang their wards, hide under their beds, and wait for dawn. Winter can be harsh, but those who survive the winter fever retain the strength of the madness it brings.
